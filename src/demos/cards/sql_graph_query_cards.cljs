  "# Graph Queries Against SQL

  This demo leverages the `fulcro-sql` library to run UI graph queries against an SQL database. The
  [documentation for fulcro-sql](https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-sql) covers the full setup.

  NOTE: To run this demo, you must:

  1. Run your server REPL with -Dpostgres as a JVM argument.
  2. Install PostgreSQL on your machine
  3. Create a database called `accounts` (e.g. createdb accounts)
  4. Run this page against the running demo server (i.e. port 8081)

  Files of interest:

  `src/demos/config/migrations/V1__account_schema.sql` - Initial schema and some sample rows
  `src/demos/config/demos.edn` - Configuration for demo server, include sql db config
  `src/demos/config/accountpool.props` - HikariCP connection pool props. This is how it connects to your SQL database. *You might need to edit this one*.
  `src/demos/recipes/sql_graph_query_server.clj` - The server-side code.

  This demo fully honors the UI query that is sent. That is to say if you were to remove properties from a query, then the
  server would not include them in the response.

  The initial load is exactly as you'd expect (nothing surprising):

  ```
  (df/load app :graph-demo/accounts Account {:target [:accounts]})
  ```

  The UI source is as you'd expect:
  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source Settings)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source Member)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source Account)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source Root)
  )
